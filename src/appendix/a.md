# APPENDIX A: REQUIREMENTS FOR A SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION

The Internet is fundamentally changing the world we live in – dissolving geographical and cultural borders, and shifting the dynamics of power away from government institutions and back towards  individuals and communities. While transitioning from the Industrial to the Information age, many communities are struggling to adapt to emerging trends and gain the most benefit. 

Global monetary systems are facing challenges, with over 700 financial crises occurring since 1970. There is a growing need for innovative alternatives, and while blockchain technology offers a solid foundation, it must be combined with new thought processes and support for more decentralized platforms. 

At the heart of our approach is the creation of a resilient ecosystem to support large communities to achieve its fullest potential in the emerging sovereign digital age – a model that has the potential to serve as an example for other countries and other communities across the world.

**The following described components are available today and can be deployed after our funding round.**

## Tools to Support Countries, Conscious Communities or Network States

* What
    * Many are looking to digitally  empower their own communities, they are looking for tools to do so
    * Most need a super app to organize the working and treasury of their communities.
* Why
    * Current tools are complicated, developers need to reinvent the wheel constantly
    * Current platforms typically are not really decentralized
    * Most systems don’t align well with our values like simplicity, people first or authentic

## OurWorld Venture Creator

* Status
    * The structure and core team is operational, the first startups like Sikana, ThreeFold are well on their path and quite some other projects are in the starting blocks.
* Why
    * Efficient and fair funding models are required to allow emerging markets to get access to this beautiful promise of self sovereignty.
    * It's our passion and mission to help others to be successful faster towards their purpose.
* Next Steps
    * Finalize on our fundraise of 30m USD (this document).

## Reliable Money, Smart Contract and Identity Network

* Requirements
    * We want to help the current Web3 world to be easier and safer to be used by the average person.
    * Connected to fiat currencies and also other physical and digital assets.
    * Allows web3 developers to build decentralized apps faster to provide for a better world.
    * Better background checks for the communities using the networks
* Why
    * Banks are broken, we need other systems to hold our financial assets.
    * We need global consensus driven systems for our identity and reputation.
    * We need to be able to easily create smart contracts.

## Decentralized Internet Infrastructure (ThreeFold)

* What
    * An internet infrastructure which is co-owned, truly decentralized and which has capability to keep on providing service even if there are disruptions (war, climate, internet cable cut, …)
    * Compatible with Web2 and Web3
* Why
    * Current Internet is much more vulnerable than people thing, we should not rely on centralized services like Amazon, … (which are also expensive)
    * Most countries don’t have their own Internet, Internet is GDP Negative
* Status
    * ThreeFold is an open source movement now. Generation 3, growing every day, see [www.threefold.io](http://www.threefold.io). Only 15m USD marketcap
* Next steps	
    * Roll out generation 4, with upgrade to tokenomics.
    * Make it much more operationally decentralized (gitcoin, dao’s, …)

## 3Bot Digital Virtual Assistant + Web3 Gateway

* What
    * A system which allows us to own all our data and our digital life capabilities, this allows us to become truly self sovereign.
    * A system which is our personal more convenient and safe gateway to the web2 and web3 world. Speaks with web 2 (mail, chat, files, …) and web 3 (Ethereum, Bitcoin, …).
    * A lot of complicated digital matters become very easy to use, our 3Bot will support us for any current and future digital requirement. Developers can add capabilities to our 3Bot.
* Why
    * Allow developers to develop faster and create peer-to-peer applications for the future
    * Connect the old and new world, in a convenient way.
    * Bring more safety and sovereignty to each user.
    * Super scalable, this system together with Ethereum and ThreeFold allows us to have our digital life without any servers or other centralized services
* Next steps
    * Deliver version 0.9 as working prototype to prove the concept.
    * Make it much more operationally decentralized (Gitcoin, DAOs, …) 

## Autonomous Projects or FreeFlow Circles

* What: a way how to organize your projects 
    * Each project (or FreeFlow Circle) has following features
        * Fundraise Through Private Token Offering
        * Consensus driven Human Chain (like blockchain for validating all decisions, change requests, information changes, spending of funds, …), Effective Collaboration Tools
        * Effective Documentation and Knowledge Management System
        * Integrated Private AI System (organize your knowledge, use AI as a tool to be more efficient)
        * Integration with Digital FreeZone to allow the project to act as a Custodian and Exchange.
* Why
    * The typical blockchain based governance DAO systems are complicated to finetune and positioned as a one size fits all solution, we believe a lot more flexibility is required.
    * We need a fundamentally different approach how we manage our many projects in a more decentralized but highly efficient way

## FlowMoney = Zero Friction Payments, Exchange & Reward System

* What
    * A system which allows people to transact money and rewards without any friction anywhere in the world for everyone, connecting and rolling up into the money network like Ethereum.
    * Supports peer-to-peer exchange of any asset for any other asset or currency.
* Why
    * Allow people to transact anything even if the internet is down or unreliable.
    * Support millions of transactions per second per internet region
    * Allow governments to deploy at any scale for any of their citizens even if in rural areas.
    * Cost per transaction needs to be +- zero.
    * Allows to connect to the reliability and settlement of Ethereum network
* Next steps
    * Deliver version 0.9 (is part of our 3Bot effort), Gitcoin, DAO, …

## OurWorld Digital Free Zone

* What
    * A digital freezone with full legal, administrative, corporate and financial sovereignty.
    * The idea is to allow people to mirror their assets, company's and identity in the freezone.
    * Seamless integrated in 3Bot and affordable for everyone
* Why
    * Everyone can be sovereign and free even if you live in a challenging area.
    * Allows everyone to collaborate in a fully regulated way, with frictionless financial services.
    * Allows everyone to regulate their maybe challenging digital (crypto) requirements.

## Sikana

* What
    * An education video platform who has 4 billion views and hosts more than 2200 videos. 
* Why
    * Education is a human right, it should be available to everyone, everywhere and lowest possible cost in their language taking their local culture into account
* Next steps
    * We want to make this system fully decentralized on top of the decentralized Internet.
    * Everyone can make content, translate, curate and teach.

## OurWorld Financial Services (2024+)

* What
    * Add full blown financial services to the freezone for the regular member.
    * Allow companies to get access to fintech licenses (e-money, banking, custodian) in a very easy way with technology and license and regulations.
    * As a first step we want to support a decentralized network of gold vaults and debit cards.

* Why
    * Current financial institutes are no longer trustworthy, we need co-owned regulated structures where we can trust our financial organizations that our assets and money will be safe and not leveraged.

* This system will not be developed in phase 1 of the venture creator.
