## The Commons

"The Commons" refers to resources that belong to or affect the whole of a community. These resources are collectively owned or shared between or among populations. These resources are said to be "held in common" and can include everything from natural resources and common land to software that is open for all to use.

There are several types of commons:

* Utility Providing Commons: Electricity Generation (bio reactor, solar), Water Purification, Internet Generation. 
* Digital Commons: These are information and knowledge resources that are collectively created and owned or shared between or among a community and that tend to be distributed over digital networks. This can include open-source software, open-access scholarly articles, and public-domain digital content.
* Natural Commons: These are natural resources such as air, water, and a stable climateâ€”things that everyone requires and which aren't created by human beings.
* Cultural Commons: These are created collectively by a community and include language, traditions, holidays, and cultural heritage.

The management of the commons, particularly the natural commons, has been a subject of debate for centuries, going back to what is known as the tragedy of the commons, which refers to the overuse or degradation of common resources due to individual actions that collectively lead to resource depletion.

## Quadratic funding

Quadratic funding is a democratic funding mechanism for public goods. It is a mathematical method that optimizes the allocation of funds to projects based on the preferences of contributors. The term "quadratic" refers to the formula used to determine the amount of matching funds a project will receive, which is proportional to the square of the sum of the square roots of contributions.

In a quadratic funding pool, a shared pool of funds is allocated among different projects or initiatives. Each participant can contribute money to their preferred projects. The funding from the pool is then matched to each project in a way that favors projects with broad public support.

Quadratic funding is based on the principle that the societal value of a public good is not just the sum of individual valuations, but rather the sum of individual valuations squared. This means that a project that many people support a little should receive more funding than a project that a few people support a lot.

This system is designed to incentivize and leverage small contributions, reward diversity of opinion, and avoid concentration of funding into a few hands.
