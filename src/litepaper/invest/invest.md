# Invest In OurWorld Venture Creator

Structure

- preferred convertible loan.
- option to convert in mother or any of the daughters at own convenience with valuation protection.

Imagine a funding mechanism which:

* Allows you to do good for the world as well as for your family and yourself
* Gives you the potential upside of a high tech startup
* Gives you the protection of an asset-backed bond (backing by shares of all our companies) 
* Gives you flexibility of a stock exchange (planned end 2024)
* Allows you to deploy hundreds of millions of dollars (through our Daughter Venture Creators and The Commons Utility Projects, which are infrastructure projects using our technology)
* Allows you to invest in a flexible way (Gold, USD, Digital Currencies, Dubai, Europe, US, Mauritius, …)


OurWorld Venture Creator offers investors an attractive and flexible investment opportunity through a tokenized bond, with the potential to convert at a discounted rate into shares of OurWorld Venture Creator, TFTech or any of the other startups as created by the Venture Creator.

## Intention

Our intention is to enable “Commons” based infrastructure projects delivering, for example, clean energy, safe Internet capacity, earth regeneration, healthy food, clean water, authentic e-education and e-health. 

We are working with financial partners to structure vehicles that could mobilize billions of USD for these “Commons” based projects. Once the projects are operational and providing return, community-owned Cooperative structures will buy back the shares of these projects as well as from the Venture Creator.
