# What is a Venture Creator

A Venture Creator is a venture (company) that creates other ventures (startups) . The purpose is to create, launch and scale high valued businesses, typically developing an idea into a product, then creating a healthy value based venture - using their own resources and networks. OurWorld is a Venture Creator. Our team has a lot of expertise in building and growing such ventures”

A Venture Creator is a skilled and value driven team with deep domain expertise and the ability to create and launch a product or service fast.  Lean Startup methodologies and Agile Software Development techniques play a critical part in enabling venture Creators to develop multiple systems, models and products.  The key objective is to build a Minimum Viable Product - rapidly without losing the importance and values and the Why.  Then use the MVP feedback loop to build, measure and learn.  If a product gains has proven to be worthwhile and valuable, then Venture Creators will move from the Product Development Stage to the Company Creation Stage with the help of initial own Financial resources and later attracting additional like minded investors.

The most successful Venture Creators combine key skills, experience, and networks to build companies from startup phase through to scale up, with a particular focus on;

1. Find the right balance between values and mission/vision
2. Help the team to articulate their purpose and create the right materials to express their ideas.
3. Building Planet and People first Teams who are pragmatic enough to ground an idea and make it happen.
4. Product Development, Minimal Requirements, Value Based Product Differentiation
5. OpenSource based Business Models.
6. Applicable go to Market Strategy or launching using our existing own networks from previous projects.
7. Legal & Financial Support
8. Help Raising Capital.
9. Leveraging our own Networks

The model is different to traditional Venture Capital.  Venture capital firms are different as they are not operational organizations. They invest in promising teams and business ideas that meet their criteria. On the other hand, Venture Creators are very involved with the daily management of the operation. When a Venture Creator owns equity in its ventures, it’s because it’s been instrumental in generating and shaping the idea and invested significant effort in growing the company — not because it provided capital.
