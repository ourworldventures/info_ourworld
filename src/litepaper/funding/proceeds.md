## Use of proceeds for existing company's planned as follows:

1. Invest 5+5m EUR in ThreeFold, integrate AI into our TFGrid, promote the 3Bot with Web 3 gateway, work with large communities like Ethereum, create practical decentralized solutions on the TFGrid. The result is the further expansion of our global decentralized Internet infrastructure platform. Organize a crowdfunding campaign together with the community for our self-sovereign digital platform.
2. Invest 2m EUR in the Digital Free Zone in Zanzibar, enabling hundreds of thousands of people with a sovereign financial, legal and digital life. Show how a sovereign being is possible on a larger scale. Organize a government supported crowdfunding pre-sales campaign for +50m USD which will be used to fund startups. Includes the software platform for sustainable regenerative cities.
3. Invest 2m EUR in Sikana, to make the education platform fully decentralized and roll it out on top of the ThreeFold Grid. Create a decentralized movement (cooperative) and fundraising campaign (from the free zone) for scaling the solution to a global level, where everyone can be a teacher and a student.
4. The rest is for venture creation & incubation and will be decided upon by board of venture creator:
    - e.g. +- 1m EUR to realize our digital funding platform for the OurWorld Venture Creator (Digital Notes + Liquidity Pool + Governance Solution for the Venture Creator) + Internal Workings.
    - e.g. 1m EUR to realize the Mama Samia Institute in Tanzania (a Daughter Venture Creator with the president of Tanzania), 50m EUR will be fundraised at that level resulting in value creation for our bigger ecosystem and practical rollout of the system to potentially tens of millions of people.
5. If we reach +25m EUR funding we can consider to invest in an Earth Regenerator + Team

At initial stage only 10m EUR will be invested, and based on milestones more will be released
