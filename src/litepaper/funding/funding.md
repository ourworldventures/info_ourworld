## Funding Round

ThreeFold and OurWorld have been created and grown by an experienced team who had great successes before. Our previous venture creator (called Incubaid, see [www.incubaid.com](http://www.incubaid.com) ) generated a 10x average return for our investors and had +600 million USD exits. OurWorld Venture Creator is the next iteration of Incubaid. 

OurWorld Venture Creatorâ€™s exit strategy is based on maximizing value through its holdings of shares in its multiple startups and Daughter Venture Creators. 

We want to offer investors a diversified risk profile and significant growth potential.

Furthermore, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">investors will also have the option</span> to participate directly in each of the underlying projects. OurWorld Venture Creator is located in Mauritius, a stable and well-regulated location that provides additional protection for investors.
