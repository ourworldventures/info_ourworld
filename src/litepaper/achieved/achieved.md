We are establishing **OurWorld Digital Free Zone in partnership with the government of Zanzibar.** 

Imagine a world where you can do frictionless business at the speed of light, using our co-owned, co-agreed financial and regulatory framework. 

This zone has the ability to deliver true financial, business and information freedom with a special focus on authenticity. Our aim is to bring millions of people together in this zone digitally and make it affordable for all. Such a zone can be used to organize co-ownership structures, security token offerings, legal supported DAO’s, etc.

- Probably the first one in the world with following incredible features:
  - we are the regulator
  - tax & corporate sovereignty
