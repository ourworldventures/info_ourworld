* ThreeFold Grid (a deployment of this technology in an open source model) and is active for years, also in generation 3, every day the community is adding capacity and using it (see [https://dashboard.grid.tf/explorer/statistics](https://dashboard.grid.tf/explorer/statistics) ). The community invested more than 30m USD.
* ThreeFold has developed all the technology required for an upgraded Internet and is now in generation 3.
* We signed heads of agreement with the Zanzibar government for a Digital Free Zone using our technology and another government will follow in H1 2023 (+60m people) for a new Internet and digital backbone.
* We are finalizing our 3Bot and Web3 Gateway, streamlining the process for developers to create influential decentralized applications with minimal effort while ensuring greater privacy and security for end users.
