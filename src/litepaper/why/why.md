We are a grounded project, for phase one we have following tools available:

* Decentralized and co-owned Internet and Digital Backbone Platform ready to scale.
* A Digital FreeZone and accompanying Charter City.
* Secure Private Personal Web3 Access Point and Personal Digital Assistant, to deliver all requirements of your digital life. Compatible with any Web 2&3 interface or protocol.
* Reliable cross border & micro payments, millions of transactions per second, supports unreliable network connectivity (even offline) and offers equal chances for everyone.
* Governance Tech Layer, addressing legal, corporate & financial requirements for any size community.

We are establishing **OurWorld Digital Free Zone in partnership with the government of Zanzibar.** Imagine a world where you can do frictionless business at the speed of light, using our co-owned, co-agreed financial and regulatory framework. This zone has the ability to deliver true financial, business and information freedom with a special focus on authenticity. Our aim is to bring millions of people together in this zone digitally and make it affordable for all. Such a zone can be used to organize co-ownership structures, security token offerings, legal supported DAO’s, etc.

We are creating the tools (i.e. the city platform) for a new **Regenerative Charter City** in Zanzibar, spanning 1,000,000 square meters of beautiful land, with a focus on innovative governance, convenience, sustainability, permaculture, food safety, human health through a blend of traditional and cutting edge knowledge. This city will serve as a hub of earth regeneration and other digital innovations, where we can work alongside thousands of like-minded changemakers to build a better world. We will organize and co-own the city as a cooperative with an enhanced DAO governance structure, ensuring that everyone has a say in its development and direction.
