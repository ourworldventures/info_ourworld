> There is too much talk in this world and not enough practial action.

At ourworld we have created a concrete plan to achieve below described goals. Together with our partners we have all technology available to make this happen.

We exists to resolve the following concrete issues:

- [We don't help our kids](help_our_kids.md)
- [Countries don't have their own Internet](countries_have_no_internet.md)
- [Shortage of Electricity](electricity_shortage.md)
- [Access to Clean Water](water.md)
- [Datacenters are wrongly built.](improve_datacenters.md)
- [Land Erosion](land_erosion.md)
- [Food is no Longer Food](food_no_longer_food.md)
- [Migration to Cities is inhumane](migration_to_cities.md)
- [Extraction Capitalism](extraction.md)

### Our Earth Regenerator helps nature & countries.

- Stop desertification (land degradation)
- Stop hunger, make sure everyone has clean water and access to healthy food. There is enough for everyone.
- Stop the migration to cities, allow our children to grow up in nature and maintain connection with mother earth.
- Make sure everyone has equal chances to a prosperous and abundant life. There is no reason to live in survival mode.
- Helps countries to become sovereign and and stops extraction of their resources.


### Say no to Holywood and Big Investors

We cannot create a new future by keep on doing what we have been doing before (Einstein).

A new platform is needed which allows our young population to manage their future differently.

We need a shift from centralization to community based working.
