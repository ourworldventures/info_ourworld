# Emerging countries are being extracted

![](img/mozambique-min.jpeg)

The image above from Mozambique portrays the harsh realities of mining operations in less developed regions. It depicts a setting where workers endure conditions that would be deemed unacceptable in more advanced economies. These workers are likely extracting valuable resources, yet the compensation and working standards are vastly disproportionate to the global market value of these resources. This scene is a vivid reminder of the inequities in global resource exploitation and the urgent need for ethical reform in such industries.

In emerging countries, two major types of resource extraction present significant challenges: natural resource extraction and brain drain. Natural resource extraction, often driven by multinational corporations, can lead to environmental issues, economic instability, and social unrest due to weak governance and uneven benefit distribution. For instance, Africa, despite its mineral and oil richness, sees limited local economic gains. Simultaneously, brain drain exacerbates these challenges, as skilled professionals emigrate for better opportunities. Around 70,000 skilled professionals leave Africa annually, depleting local talent pools essential for growth and innovation. Addressing these issues calls for stronger governance, improved local opportunities, and fairer global economic practices.

But what if today's technologies would allow us to empower local commuities with better solutions to develop their economy, retain talent, and build the future they would like to live in? This is core to the mission of OurWorld, and we believe we can do so with our venture creator and ecosystem partners.
