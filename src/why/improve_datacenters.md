# Datacenters are Outdated

In an era where artificial intelligence is reshaping our technological landscape, it’s imperative to reconsider how we design and operate datacenters. 

Over the last 30 years, datacenter construction has largely remained static, following a traditional model that is increasingly proving inadequate in the face of modern demands. 

This approach has seen power requirements rise modestly from 5 kW to around 15 kW per rack – a figure that barely scratches the surface of what is needed today.

Contemporary datacenters, with their focus on real estate, risk becoming obsolete if they continue to neglect evolving needs. 

As we stand at this technological crossroads, the urgency to adapt is clear: unless we pay close attention, new datacenters risk repeating the inefficiencies of their predecessors, leading to a poor utilization of investments and a significant mismatch with current and future requirements.

## Tier 3 Datacenters are not economical

At 20kw per rack which is way too low in comparison to the requirements for AI, such a datacenter barely makes a return over 20 years.

If we make same calc but with 30 kw per rack, which still low the datacenter makes a loss.
