## One of our cash generators short term = Tier S Datacenters

See [https://info.ourworld.tf/datacenter/](img/https://info.ourworld.tf/datacenter/). 

Classic Tier 3 Data Centers are being invested in everywhere in the world. These are good investments but because of the AI revolution these data centers are no longer good enough to fulfill the needs of the future.

There is lots of funding available to make these projects fly.

Reasoning goes as follows

An investor which wants to invest in datacenters can chose a Tier 3 Datacenter 

* Return of maybe 10% if they do well per year.
* Good assets behind (real estate), good protection
* Not ready for AI workloads
* Super difficult to generate power for (electricity), many places run on diesel or crude oil
* They don’t have the expertise to make them work well commercially
* 
Or they can chose a Tier S Datacenter

* Return of x6 over 6 years is possible.
* Ready for any future workload.
* A Tier S is a datacenter that’s carbon negative (good for the planet)
* A lot less expertise needed to run them.

See the business model around our Tier S datacenter in [this document](datacenter_biz/overview.md)

### Biz Model for TFTech for Tier S datacenters

Licenses for the Tier S datacenters are sold by TFTech, and we outsource all logistics and building elements to local partners.

The income for ThreeFold is about 15m USD for a 5 megawatt Tier S datacenter over 6 years.

TFTech commercializes the software as has been used in our opensource projects.

Belgium company, the business model is very simple.

We support the TFGrid with upselling to TFGrid commercial farmers, this is done by licenses per node (see above), we also plan to do some OEM deals because this shows traction and is good for future potential M&A discussions.

The Tier S datacenters are expected to be our main business over the next few years, each datacenter can bring in 5-10x ROI over 6 years.

Funding required to execute on the above plan is 5m EUR. 

## Investments done

OurWorld Holding will own 100% of ThreeFold Dubai, TFTech, Sikana and technology as developed by Incubaid. 

More than 50m USD has been invested over these companies and projects by investors and members of the community.

* 20m EUR in TFTech (convertible loan, which converted into shares in a luxembourg holding company), ourworld will own 100% of Sikana.

* +-15-20m EUR by farmers (TF Community Members) who invested in hardware and datacenter opex costs, to build out the TF Grid.
