## Investment Policy

### Venture Creator  Funding Strategy
    
- Phase 1: 
  - Through a Convertible Loan Agreement which will convert into a Convertible Digital Bond Structure issued by the ultimate parent company (see Section 1) we want to connect Investors to exciting Ventures with a real purpose and driving mass adoption of the OurWorld technology portfolio. OurWorld Holding is fundraising 30m USD as Convertible Bond which gives the investor the right to convert into shares with discounts and the further option to swap into any specific Venture launched by the Venture Creator or the Venture Creator itself; all subject to specific offering terms issued by OurWorld Holding.
- Phase 2: 
  - OurWorld Holding has a lot of projects lined up for the future, once the initial phase of funding is completed OurWorld Holding intends to fundraise an additional 30 million USD to complete on phase 2 of growth. Also this round may be structured as an extension to the Convertible Loan Note instrument or another suitable investment vehicle.  
- Phase 3: 
  - In parallel to phase 1 and 2, OurWorld Holding has initiated and is preparing for "Commons" based infrastructure projects around Planet and People first Energy Generation, Safe Internet Capacity, Earth Regeneration, Food, Water Safety, e-Education and e-Health. We are working with partners to structure vehicles that could mobilize significant capital investment and return for and on these  “Commons”. Once the projects are operational and providing return, community owned cooperative structures will buy back the shares of these projects as well as from our Venture Creator.

### Venture Investment Strategy

- To realize our vision we invest in Ventures which provide a piece of the puzzle. Each venture has to agree with our values which are 
  - Planet First
    - The health of our planet cannot be ignored.Every action we do as a group needs to have the best interests for our planet.
  - People First
    - Every action needs to be in the best interest of our citizens
    - Safety, equality, education, health, privacy and sovereignty is a right.
- The ventures we foster span a broad spectrum of industry sectors (from internet infrastructure, special economic zones, AI, e-education, e-Health, earth regeneration, cross-border payments and remittance, amongst others) and are chosen for their interoperability and potential synergies with other projects within our portfolio and their alignment with our vision. 
- We want to use our experience and existing technology to help startups to make progress faster.

### Venture Investment Criteria & Project Feasibility
 
Criteria assessed include:

- Community Impact: The project should have the potential to enable a large community and make a positive societal impact for the people and the planet.
- Potential: The venture must introduce a substantial disruptive element for its use case
- Scalability: demonstrate strong potential for scalability, along with a clear action plan to achieve set goals.
- Technology: The technology used should be open source and strive for simplicity.  Technology needs to be a tool towards the ability to resolve a real problem which is aligned with our vision.
- Interoperability: The venture should show synergistic potential with other projects within our portfolio.
- Environmental Impact: The venture should incorporate an impactful sustainability component.
- Exit/Liquidity Strategy: Opportunistic based on significant potential for value creation.

Members of the OurWorld team will participate actively wherever they can, serving as subject matter executives and/or board members. Along with providing intellectual capital, OurWorld will also assume entrepreneurial risk with each project through equity and other forms of participation.

### Return Potential and Bond Structure

OurWorld finances its projects using convertible loans structured as (optionally digital and transferrable) notes (Bonds). These Notes accrue interest at a rate of 10% per annum. The interest is calculated using the 365-day rule from the date of settlement to the conversion or repayment date.

**A key feature of these loans is that they offer the potential to be converted into equity. Specifically, loan holders can opt to convert their loans into the highest class of newly issued shares in OurWorld, whereby this  conversion option is made even more attractive by the provision of a 20% discount rate on the shares at a pre-money valuation and a max valuation of 150m USD in Venture creator for conversion (protection for investor). In addition to this, shares may be swapped onwards into any of OurWorld’s existing and or upcoming Ventures upon specific offering terms to be issued by OurWorld in due course.**

This mechanism presents an opportunity for maximum flexibility and significant returns. By having the optionality  to potentially convert the loans into equity in high-potential specific ventures, investors stand to benefit from the growth and success of any OurWorld venture.


Return expectations for ventures fall into three categories, depending on the potential multiples of the initial investment realized at the point of exit:

- Lower Range: 2-3x return
- Mid Range: 4-6x return
- Upper Range: 7-10x or above return

The timeline to exit and thus the realization of these returns typically falls within these categories:

- Short: 12-24 months
- Medium: 24-36 months
- Long: Over 36 months

Given the venture's potential and the preferential conversion terms, a mid-range return expectation within a medium-term timeline is considered viable. Despite the inherent risks associated with early-stage ventures, our selective and active involvement in these projects aims to mitigate these risks and maximize the potential for significant returns.

## Exit Strategy 
 
There are multiple exit strategies possible:

- Repayment of your Digital Bond by OurWorld 
- Sell your Digital Bonds on an OTC basis
- Exits of our Ventures: Many of our Ventures will get an exit through acquisition. The then converted and swapped Note holders have the ability to convert into the shares before exit and get their own exit that way.
Liquidity Pool: A liquidity pool may be created which allows Digital Bond and Shareholders to sell their carried interest (earliest  by 2024).
- INXIT = Internal Exit by means of providing liquidity coming from the Cooperatives around OurWorld (tbd).
- IPO / STO: This route involves listing a venture's shares on a public stock exchange or issuing security tokens. Both strategies can offer liquidity to early investors while raising capital for the venture's continued expansion.

Exit Decision-Making Process: 

- proposals for an exit transaction are subject to review and approval by the OurWorld’s investment board represented by its LPs. If there is disagreement over the valuation, independent Merger and Acquisitions experts may be engaged to provide an assessment. The average value of these assessments would then serve as the binding minimum price for executing an exit transaction. This ensures fairness and transparency in the exit process, protecting the interests of all parties involved.

## Risks and Risk Management
  
Given OurWorld's strategy of supporting innovative technology ventures, these ventures are exposed to a wide range of risks. Some can be proactively managed or mitigated through strategic measures, while others are inherent to the nature of the ventures or driven by external factors beyond OurWorld's control. This list of risks presented herein is grouped by their nature. A more detailed list of risks is disclosed as part of the venture blueprint. No representation is given on the completeness of risks, and the risks are not in the order of their significance. All risks may either lead to (1) a slight or substantial delay in the development of the ventures, (2) additional development costs due to extended timelines and/or conceptual changes, or (3) a reduced or even complete loss of return potential through exit.

**Risks related to OurWorld**
OurWorld incubates and grows innovative, early-stage ventures within the rapidly evolving technology sector. This leads to a high degree of unpredictability due to rapid changes in technology, legal requirements, market dynamics, and emerging innovations. Also, there's a significant exposure to external market-risks which could arise through sudden market shifts causing liquidity constraints and high volatility. In addition, the level of substantiation and the reliability of projected venture value is significantly lower due to the early-stage nature of the ventures, which may lead to temporary or permanent impairment.

OurWorld manages those risks through: 

- (1) maintaining an experienced team with a deep and forward-looking understanding of all related actualities and forthcoming impacts
- (2) balanced allocation of venture creator resources across ventures of varying sectors and stages of development
- (3) limit the number of concurrent ventures to our capacity for direct involvement, ensuring effective risk oversight

**Risks Related to Individual Ventures**

Each venture carries its specific risk profile given its stage of conceptual and corporate development. These risks could stem from conceptual errors, operational inefficiencies, market adoption challenges, changes in legal landscapes, or technical difficulties. Additionally, pre-launch stage ventures face risks related to compliance, market conditions, and community-building.

OurWorld manages those risks through: 

- (1) building a resilient digital and financial infrastructure for inter-dependent ventures using utilities as an anchor of it strategy 
- (2) requiring a comprehensive blueprint that articulates the venture’s conceptual structure, feasibility, and implementation strategy
- (3) being significantly involved in each venture’s development, ensuring strategic alignment, effective project management, and risk mitigation at each step
- (4) hire experienced professionals with a deep and forward-looking understanding of all related actualities and forthcoming impacts of the venture.

- Issuance of additional loan notes with the consequence of potential further equity dilution
