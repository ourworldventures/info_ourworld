# Universal Access to Pure Water

![alt_text](img/wayout.png)

The WayOut water system is an innovative solution for producing clean, sustainable drinking water. Here's how it works:

- **Modular Production System**: The system can clean any source of water, making it safe for drinking and cooking. Each micro-factory is built locally, reducing transport costs and parts required.
- **Treatment Process**: It uses a 12-step process for water treatment, including techniques such as sand filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet disinfection. This process not only cleans the water but also remineralizes it.
- **Capacity**: A standard system in a container can produce up to 20,000 liters of water per day, enough for 10,000 people. Smaller units can supply 8,000 liters of clean water a day, sufficient for 2,000 people.
- **Sustainability**: The system can operate off-grid using renewable energy and is designed to replace single-use plastic bottles. Water is stored in smart stainless-steel kegs with digital chips that monitor the water's healthfulness.
- **Digital Integration**: Taps on the system are connected to the cloud, allowing owners to understand usage patterns and manage demand. The system includes a digital dashboard for real-time monitoring and control.
- **Containerized System**: It's a plug-and-play system, with the containerized treatment train including filters, ion exchange, and UV disinfection. The system is divided into a treatment area and an operator area.
- **Water Dispensation**: Clean water is transferred into metallic kegs and delivered to customers. The kegs are cleaned with ozone and are used for water transport.

This system aims to bring control of clean water sources into communities, improving local health and reducing reliance on plastic bottles.
