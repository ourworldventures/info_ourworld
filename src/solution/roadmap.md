## Roadmap

![](../ventures/img/roadmap.png)

### Step 1a: deliver 1 or 2 smaller Tier S Datacenters.

Utilize the allocated funds for constructing data centers in select countries across Africa and potentially South America, with a focus on developing Tier S Datacenters. These facilities should prioritize innovative and clean methods for electricity generation, exploring various sustainable options at our disposal.

Successfully completing and selling one or two of these projects will significantly enhance our credibility and financial standing. This achievement will not only validate our capabilities but also enable us to secure additional funding. Such financial support will be crucial for the widespread deployment of earth regenerators.

By selling just two to three projects, we can ensure that OurWorld startups become cashflow positive, marking a pivotal step in our journey towards sustainable and profitable operations.

### Step 1b: deploy a first Earth Regenerator in Zanzibar.

An Earth Regenerator is a smaller size Tier S Datacenter, Organic Fertilizer, Clean Water & Energy Production.

The Zanzibar government has generously allocated 1,000,000 square meters of land to us. Our vision is to utilize this land for constructing a Earth Regenerator, along with a dedicated training and meeting center. This initiative aims to showcase our collaborative efforts with nature in regenerating our planet.

The first earth regenerator will demonstrate the following:

- Tier S Datacenter Capacity
- Complementary digital backbone:
  - scalable sovereign education system
  - digital twin technology: equal future for everyone
  - localized AI Platform usable for thousands of usecases
  - metaverse and augmented reality platform with pixel streaming.
  - meshed peer2peer sovereign Internet Connectivity
- also leading to production of
  - organic furtilizer and other land regeneration products
  - sustainable electricity generation
  - clean drinking water for 20,000 people
  - permaculture food production

A local education and demonstration facility will showcase the following:

- Commercial Viability: Achieving a Return on Investment (ROI) in under 5 years.
- Land Restoration: Demonstrating the capacity to rejuvenate land.
- Food Production: Showcasing efficient agricultural methods.
- Digital Development: Educating on digital capabilities and development.
- Resource Generation: Methods to produce water, electricity, and more.
- Economic Model: Understanding the financial system underpinning the project.

We estimate the budget for this system to be around $10 million USD. We are currently seeking investors who are committed to making this vision a reality.

As an incentive, investors will receive 10% of the revenue from every future Earth Regenerator sold until they have earned twice their initial investment.


### Q2 2024: +1000 nodes in Africa for TFGrid

-  We're actively encouraging our community to deploy at least 1000 nodes in the coming months. This effort aims to demonstrate a strong interest in decentralized cloud capacity within Africa.

### Q2 2024: Sikana Hosted on Digital Twin Tech 

-  Sikana goes on top of the TFGrid and becomes first class citizen on our decentralized network.

### Q3 2024: Digital Freezone Goes Life

- We expect our Digital FreeZone to be operational beginning H2 2024 and accept first customers.



### H1 2025: TFTech Strategic Option

- Check if we can do a meaningful strategic transaction for TFTech
- We have sold 7 tech companies in the past and what have built with TFTech is by far the most capable technology we have ever created.
- Our current roll out of TFGrid is already an incredible proof point today
- Once we have sold 1 or 2 Tier S datacenter projects and announced some partnerships with countries then our transaction value might be Unicorn Level.
- The proceeds come into our Venture Creator and finance any future funding need.

remark: necessary conditions to do such a strategic deal

- 5m USD funding in TFTech (as planned)
- a senior management team in TFTech
- implement more operational capabilities.
