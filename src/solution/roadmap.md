## Roadmap

### Step 1a: sell some initial Tier S Datacenters.

Use the available funding for datacenters in countries (Africa and maybe South America) to build Tier S Datacenters instead with special attention for how to cleanly generate the electricity, we have a multitude of options available.

Once 1 or 2 are sold this will give us all the required credibility and funding to fundraise much more money and deploy the earth regenerators.

Selling only 2 a 3 projects are enough to make OurWorld startups cashflow positive.

There are 3 projects we are working on.

### Step 1b: deploy a first earth regenerator in Zanzibar.

The government of Zanzibar has granted us 1,000,000m2 land, we would like to use this land to build a first earth regenerator as well as a training and meetings center to allow everyone to see how we together with mother nature can regenerate our land.

The first earth regenerator will demonstrate the following:

- production of
  - organic furtilizer and other land regeneration products
  - sustainable electricity generation
  - biochar, who has capability to become Graphene (the holy grail material) (*)
  - clean drinking water for 20,000 people
  - clean water for agriculture and farming
  - permaculture food production
- community owned digital backbone:
  - scalable sovereign education system
  - internet cloud capacity
  - digital twin technology: equal future for everyone
  - localized AI Platform usable for thousands of usecases
  - metaverse and augmented reality platform with pixel streaming.
  - meshed peer2peer sovereign Internet Connectivity
  

A local education & demonstration facility will be able to show:
- commercial viability (ROI < 5 years)
- restoration capabilities of land
- food production capabilities
- digital capabilities and how to develop on it
- how to generate water, electricity, ...
- the economic system behind

The required budget for such a system will be about 10m USD and we are looking for dedicated investors who have as interest to make this happen.

10% of every future earth regenerator sold will go to these investors until they receive 2x their invested money.

### Step 2a:

- Sell TFTech for +1 Billion USD.
- We have sold 7 tech companies in the past and what have built with TFTech is by far the most capable technology we have ever created.
- Our current roll out of TFGrid is already an incredible proof point and should allow us to sell our company for +100m USD (for sure).
- But once we have sold 1 or 2 Tier S datacenter projects and announced some partnerships with countries then our price will be above 1billion USD.
- These proceeds come into our Venture Creator and finance any future funding need.

remark: necessary conditions to sell TFTech 

- 5m USD funding in TFTech (as planned)
- a senior management team in TFTech
- some more operational capabilities.
