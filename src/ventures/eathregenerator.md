# Earth Regenerator


- Overview: The Earth Regenerator harnesses photobioreactor technology for environmental restoration and renewable energy production.
- Problem: Excessive CO2 emissions, chemical fertilizers, fossil fuel reliance, nutrient waste, and ecosystem degradation pose significant environmental challenges.
- Solution: Photobioreactors provide a multifaceted solution, absorbing CO2, producing high amounts of biofertilizers, biomass for renewable energy, and restoring ecosystems.
- Business model: All technology, software and knowledge is open source. Revenue generated from Commercial Licenses. ROI on first bioreactor was achieved under 2 years.
- Market: Sovereign funds, carbon market and more. Differentiator: High ROI model and multiple revenue streams
- compared to most bioreactor technologies.
- Status: Technology exists already. PoC done. Waiting for more funding to build team and commercialize technology.
