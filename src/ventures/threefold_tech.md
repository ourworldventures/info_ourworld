## Venture Highlights 

- **Overview**: ThreeFold Tech is a trailblazer in autonomous, decentralized, and sustainable internet and cloud infrastructure technology (software).
- **Mission**: To reshape the internet and cloud infrastructure landscape with a focus on decentralization, autonomy, and sustainability.
- **Problem**: The centralized nature of current internet and cloud infrastructures leads to inefficiencies, security vulnerabilities, and a lack of sustainability.
- **Market Opportunity**: Addressing a rapidly expanding global internet infrastructure market worth $Trillions, with demand in sectors like AI, IoT, cloud computing, and autonomous vehicles.
- **Products and Services**: Decentralized Autonomous OS, Quantum Safe Storage, Edge Cloud Computing Platform, and Mycelium Network, together creating a comprehensive and autonomous cloud infrastructure solution (software).
- **Stage of Development**: The software used on decent scale in TFGrid, we now need to strengthen executive team and commercially launch our solutions.
- **Key Differentiators**: Uniquely autonomous and hyper-scalable infrastructure through software, offering significant energy savings and enhanced security compared to traditional models.
- **Business Model**: Licensing and supporting specific deployments, such as [Tier-S data centers](https://info.ourworld.tf/datacenter/datacenter/intro/intro.html), with an OEM strategy for broader market access.
- **Planned Exit**: M&A +500m USD (preferred option) or Recurring revenue streams (priv equity, or stock exchange)


### Unique: our Software allows the following:

- **100% Autonomous IT**: At the core of ThreeFold Tech's approach is the development of an operating system and infrastructure that are entirely self-operating and self-healing. This autonomy is a game-changer, as it removes the need for human intervention, thereby enhancing security and operational efficiency. 
- **Hyper-Scalability**: there are no scalability limits to how our software works, our software can enable billions of devices and people.
- **Ultra-Sustainability**: for storage we can safe upto 10x in energy usage, for compute 2-3x.
- **Commitment to Open Source and Community**

### What: Software for Decentralized, Autonomous and Ultra-Efficient Internet Infrastructure.

The software platform includes:

- **Decentralized Autonomous OS**: Facilitates streamlined operations at the network's edge, running on any modern computer.
- **Quantum Safe Storage**: Offers an ultra-scalable and secure storage system, compatible with most tools and protocols.
- **Edge Cloud Computing Platform**: Provides a comprehensive and autonomous platform for a variety of IT workloads.
- **Mycelium Network**: Ensures fast and secure data transfers with end-to-end encryption.

These components enable smart-contract-enabled deployments, leading to significant energy savings of up to 90% and unparalleled security, a substantial improvement over traditional cloud models. Additionally, TFTech's open-source code is utilized by the [ThreeFold Grid](https://dashboard.grid.tf/explorer/statistics), a globally-distributed grid of storage, compute, and network capacity.
