## ThreeFold Tech

- About: An innovative technology software company that has built the technology behind [The ThreeFold Grid](threefold_cloud.md).
- Problem: Today's internet is incredibly centralized, complex, not scalable and unsustainable. Also, we all became products of the data industry – our sovereignty is at threat.
- Solution: An ultra-efficient and fully autonomous OS that can run on any modern computer to enable a decentralized edge cloud platform for any current or future IT workloads.
- Business model: sell licenses to commercial usecases for people who want to deploy the technology themselves.
- Market: +$500b market for autonomous, edge, sovereign infra. Differentiator: Software only – no CAPEX (outsourced to node
operators). 100% automated stack, smart contract deployments.
- Progress: Technology rolled out on large scale, we now need to strengthen executive team and commercially launch our solutions.
