## Unique: our Software allows the following:

- **100% Autonomous IT**: At the core of ThreeFold Tech's approach is the development of an operating system and infrastructure that are entirely self-operating and self-healing. This autonomy is a game-changer, as it removes the need for human intervention, thereby enhancing security and operational efficiency. 
- **Hyper-Scalability**: there are no scalability limits to how our software works, our software can enable billions of devices and people.
- **Ultra-Sustainability**: for storage we can safe upto 10x in energy usage, for compute 2-3x.
- **Commitment to Open Source and Community**

## What: Decentralized, Autonomous and Ultra-Efficient Internet Infrastructure Platform

ThreeFold Tech (TFTech) has developed a pioneering autonomous cloud platform that represents a significant advancement in cloud computing technology. The platform, which has been in development since 2016, is designed to offer optimal scalability, data protection, and efficiency. It is well-suited to address the challenges and demands of the modern IT industry while adhering to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) standards.

The core of TFTechâ€™s offering is its decentralized, edge autonomous infrastructure that is adaptable and capable of functioning on any modern computer with a network connection and electricity. This approach ensures 100% autonomy, hyper-scalability, and ultra-sustainability. The lightweight operating system is specifically designed to optimize hardware space for IT workloads. The platform includes:

- **Decentralized Autonomous OS**: Facilitates streamlined operations at the network's edge, running on any modern computer.
- **Quantum Safe Storage**: Offers an ultra-scalable and secure storage system, compatible with most tools and protocols.
- **Edge Cloud Computing Platform**: Provides a comprehensive and autonomous platform for a variety of IT workloads.
- **Mycelium Network**: Ensures fast and secure data transfers with end-to-end encryption.

These components enable smart-contract-enabled deployments, leading to significant energy savings of up to 90% and unparalleled security, a substantial improvement over traditional cloud models. Additionally, TFTech's open-source code is utilized by the [ThreeFold Grid](https://dashboard.grid.tf/explorer/statistics), a globally-distributed grid of storage, compute, and network capacity.
