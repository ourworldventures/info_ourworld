## Why: Transforming Cloud Computing and Digital Infrastructure

ThreeFold Cloud aims to transform the landscape of cloud computing and digital infrastructure. It focuses on building commercial offerings on top of the [ThreeFold Grid](https://dashboard.grid.tf/explorer/statistics)(TF Grid), a globally-distributed grid of storage, compute, and network capacity, acting as “no middleman” Internet resources between independent capacity providers and users. This approach addresses the centralized, complex, and unsustainable nature of today's internet, bringing forth a solution that respects user sovereignty and promotes scalability.

## How: Ultra-efficent and fully Autonomous Cloud Platform

ThreeFold Cloud is building ultra-efficient and fully autonomous OS that can run on any modern computer to enable a decentralized edge cloud platform for any current or future IT workloads.

ThreeFold Cloud's business model is centered around building commercial offerings over the decentralized and autonomous ThreeFold Grid - eliminating the need for hardware capital expenditure (CAPEX). This strategic choice allows for a conscious allocation of resources towards the development and enhancement of cutting-edge internet storage, cloud computing and GPU solutions. Such a model allows ThreeFold Cloud to support a new range of decentralized and autonomous cloud products and services that support emerging market demands and user requirements. 

The TF Grid is an unbreakable decentralized internet infrastructure that leverages TFTech's open-source Technology, with over 30,000,000 GB storage and 60,000 vCPU cores deployed by the community over 60+ countries.
