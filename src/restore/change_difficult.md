# Why is Change so Difficult

We live in a relatively stable world. This stability makes it difficult to initiate change, and many individuals find themselves living monotonous lives filled with boredom, helplessness, and frustration. As a society, we don't teach our children how to tap into their limitless potential or recognize their inner strength. Moreover, we tend to accept daily brainwashing, as illustrated in the thought-provoking documentary "A Century of the Self," which highlights the absurd ways in which we've accepted and continue to accept manipulation. We have been programmed to accept outside authority unquestioningly, what has happened to our personal inner authority? 

A paradigm shift is happening right now. There are so many sectors in chaos right now that it's more a revolution rather than a shift. Evolution would have been easier but this requires creativity and unfortunately we have not been encouraged to be creative, adventurous and capable as we truly are. We are uncomfortable with the uncertainty and fearful of change. We have been living in a globalized world where everything has been based on money. Money became our biggest drug, a lot of people wouldnâ€™t do anything unless they are paid to do it. Those who have been programmed this way will have a hard time to adjust to a glocal world of abundance where everyone loves what they do and have respect for the gifts received from the planet and people around.

**Navigating a paradigm shift and rebuilding communities requires a shift of consciousness.
If not our work will only be like rearranging the chairs on the deck of the Titanic while going down.** 

To achieve our vision, we need modern leaders and conscious investors. Conscious investors provide the necessary financial fuel to build and deploy a new "Conscious Operating System for Humanity" in a way that allows network effects to take hold, driving natural expansion. Modern leaders serve as examples for their communities and pave the way for concrete steps to be taken to deploy and use this new system. While this might be a long-term effort spanning decades, tangible results can be experienced as early as within one year. This is not merely a dream but a tangible possibility that we can actively pursue. Are you one of the love warriors daring and adventurous enough to make it happen?

## Special thanks to

Special thanks to the teaching of Penny Kelly (especially her book, The Revival: A Path To A New Earth and New Human), Michel Bauwens who is the Inventor of the concepts around The Commons and Bernard Lietaer for his insights in the true nature of money.

We took the liberty to use some literal quotes from Penny Kelly who has as one of her incredible gifts to use words in all their simplicity to explain difficult concepts. 

The pictures used are from the Ngorongoro crater, Tanzania, Africa which shows how animals of all sorts live together and create a peaceful society. The Ngorongoro crater has been considered the crater of the birth of mankind.
