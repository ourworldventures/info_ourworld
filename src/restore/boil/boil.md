# Let's not boil the ocean

Trying to start with the whole world would be like trying to boil the whole ocean.To create a meaningful impact, we need to focus on smaller groups within a well-defined community (such as a country or diaspora). These sub-communities can become self-sufficient, responsible, self-governing, and well-connected with other sub-communities across the planet. 

We refer to each of these sub-communities as a "tribe," and the successful tribes can serve as models for other tribes within their community.

Each tribe achieves

* Feeling of belonging, together we are stronger than alone
* The chance to create a new world, no longer linked to broken structures
* Independance
* Ability to allow the members of the community to be safe and grow independent in all respect for their own culture and the planet we are part of.
