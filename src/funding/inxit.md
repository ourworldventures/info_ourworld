## INXIT

INXIT stands for INternal Exit. We want to achieve this by using our technology for creating “Commons” projects and creating Cooperatives which represent the users who have the benefit of the Commons project. As the Cooperative builds value it buys back the shares from the Venture Creator (can be the mother or any of the Daughter Venture Creators).

"The Commons" refers to resources that belong to or affect the whole of a community. These resources are collectively owned or shared between or among Communities.

Utility Providing Commons is about how a community can own their electricity generation (bioreactor, solar), water purification, Internet generation, food generation, healthcare units, education facilities… 

OurWorld Venture Creator has as goal to bootstrap many of these Commons providing the following benefits:
